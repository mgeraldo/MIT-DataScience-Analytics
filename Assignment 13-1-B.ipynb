Landfill demand can be satisfied from a set of four transfer station depots, or directly from a set of two waste generating centers.  Each transfer depot can support a maximum volume of waste moving through it, and each waste generating center can generate a maximum amount of waste.  There are known costs associated with transporting the waste, from a center to a depot, from a depot to a landfill, or from a center directly to a landfill.\n","\n","The waste network has two waste generating centers, in NewYork and NewJersey, which generate the waste.
